The objective is to create your personal website. Something that will tell the world about you and your projects.
1. Create a new empty directory named « mywebsite »
2. Create IMAGES directory and put a few image from the web in it ( using wget if you can)
3. In this directory, using your favorite text editor, create a, index.html file. It must make use of these html tags, at least : html, head, title, body,  p, h1, h2, a href, ul, li, img

## WS 2.2 : BASIC STYLING

Use css to make your content more pleasant to read.


## WS 2.3 : SETTING UP A LOCAL WEB SERVER

Instead of using local file access, let's setup a web server to serve our website. Nginx and Apache are the most used static web servers. We will start with a simple python webserver.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server

Once your website is up and running, you should be able to access it from your mobile phone. Your mobile phone and the computer running the server must be on the same local network for this to work. You will access your computer website using your computer's local ip adress, that you can find using ipconfig. It should start with 192.168. or by 10.0


## WORSHOP 2.4 MAKE YOUR WEBSITE RESPONSIVE

Now that you can see your website through your mobile phone, you can see that it does not display as well as on your computer screen. Let's make it more decent, by making it responsive : the content will be displayed differently depending on the width in pixel of the client screen.

- The menu should be horizontal on large viewport, and vertical on small viewport. 
- Images should take the full width of the page, without exceeding their original width.
- Use the chrome developper tools to show screen size selector and verify your design.
- Access your website using your phone to confirm your design is good.
